# Hey, I'm Vaishnav  👋

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub. I'm a developer from India who enjoys building useful, random, and sometimes weird stuff on the internet. I mostly work with Telegram bots, web tools, automation projects, and a bit of Android too.

## 🚀 What I'm into:

- Building **Telegram bots** (random chat bots, media tools, group manager bots, etc.)
- Making simple **websites** and dashboards using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Playing with **APIs** to connect things together (like Spotify, Pinterest, or FreeImage host)
- Making lightweight **Android apps** using AIDE
- Trying out new ideas and learning as I go

## 🧩 Current Projects

- A full-featured Telegram random chat bot (with profile, tags, gender filter, coins, reports, etc.)
- Group assistant bot with full admin tools and filters
- Image to URL bot using FreeImage.Host
- Spotify music search + download bot
- Web UI with live update system using GitHub + Render

## A few random things about me:

- I enjoy fixing bugs more than writing new code.
- I like building things people actually use, even if they’re small.
- I test everything 100 times before I trust it.
- I believe simple > complex.
