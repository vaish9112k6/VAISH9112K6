# 👋 Hey, I'm Vaishnav 

I’m not a pro coder — I just love creating things that work.

Most of my projects are built using AI tools, platforms like Bots.Business, GitHub, Replit, and Render. I mix tools, test ideas, and build bots, sites, and apps that do something useful (or just fun). You don’t need to be a coder to build cool things — you just need to start.

## 🛠️ What I Do (Without Coding Everything)

- Create **Telegram bots** using platforms and AI (random chat bots, group tools, media downloaders, etc.)
- Build simple **websites** with copy-paste code and small tweaks
- Use **APIs** smartly — I don’t code them from scratch, but I know how to use them
- Build small **Android apps** using AIDE, mostly for fun experiments
- Use **ChatGPT and online tools** to help me build and learn

## 📌 My Style

- I don’t write much code — I build using ideas and tools that work together
- I test things until they work how I want
- I don’t care about being perfect — just real, fast, and functional
- If I don’t know something, I figure it out

Thanks for visiting my profile! If you build things with tools (not just code), we’ve got something in common.
